# SEC-Filings-API
<a href="https://https://tradefeeds.com/sec-filings-api/" rel="nofollow">Tradefeeds SEC Filings API Database</a> contains more than 19 million SEC filngs of 20 000+ publicly traded companies listed on the NYSE, NASDAQ and other stock exchanges. The API database contains all 200+ types of SEC filings. Companies’ filings submitted to the EDGAR system are financial statements and reports that receive a particular form name and form description by the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission. SEC filings are arranged around six key groupings: annual fillings (Form 10-K), quarterly filings (Form 10-Q), current reports (8-K), proxy filings (DEF14A), registration statements (Form 424B2), Section 16 filings (Form4) and slightly more. Tradefeeds customers predominantly look for API for these six groupings of SEC filings. However, they are also interested in other common types of SEC filings such as: Form 6-K, Forms 3 and 5, Form S-1, Form S-3, Form S-8 , Form 20-F, Form 40-F , Schedule 13, Form 144.  SEC filings data of different companies are searchable by stock ticker symbols and form types in the API URL Path field.
